Fortify is a free time project worked on during the course of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The project has therefore been worked on sporadically. Each time i revisited the project potential improvements would always become apparent, since my programming knowlege had improved over time.

In this 2D top down roguelike shooter, the player has to protect the square shaped core from the ever increasing number of hostile enemy ships.

Features include:
  * Original art, animations, and sound effects. 

  * A leveling system, complete with both minor upgrades and gameplay altering modifications. 

  * Infinite waves of attacking enemies.
